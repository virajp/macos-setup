  Generate an HTML coverage report from a Flutter test coverage lcov.info file
  using the lcov tool (genhtml). Use this skill whenever the user wants to view
  test coverage, convert lcov.info to HTML, open a coverage report in the
  browser, check which lines are covered or uncovered, or run flutter test with
  coverage. Triggers on phrases like "coverage report", "open coverage", "view
  coverage", "lcov", "genhtml", "show me what's covered", or "test coverage HTML".

# Flutter Coverage Report

Generate an interactive HTML report from Flutter's `coverage/lcov.info` file
using the `genhtml` tool from the [lcov project](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

## Prerequisites

`genhtml` must be installed via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --formulae lcov
```

Verify it's available:

```bash
which genhtml   # should print /opt/homebrew/bin/genhtml
genhtml --version
```

## Generating Coverage Data

Run Flutter tests with coverage enabled first. The output lands at
`coverage/lcov.info` relative to the project root.

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run a specific test file with coverage
flutter test --coverage test/modules/rides/rides_service_test.dart

# Run tests matching a pattern
flutter test --coverage --name 'MyService'
```

## Converting lcov.info to HTML

Use `genhtml` to convert the trace file into a browsable HTML report.

### Standard command (recommended)

```bash
genhtml coverage/lcov.info \
  --output-directory coverage/html \
  --title "95octane Coverage" \
  --show-details \
  --highlight \
  --branch-coverage
```

### Quick one-liner (minimal flags)

```bash
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

### Options explained

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `-o` / `--output-directory` | Where to write the HTML files |
| `--title` | Title shown in the report header |
| `--show-details` | Show per-file hit/found counts on the index page |
| `--highlight` | Colour-highlight the source lines (missed = red, hit = blue) |
| `--branch-coverage` | Show branch coverage data (if present in lcov.info) |
| `--prefix PATH` | Strip a path prefix so file paths are shorter |
| `--ignore-errors source` | Continue if source files can't be found (useful in CI) |
| `-j` / `--parallel` | Use parallel processing for large projects |

## Opening the Report

```bash
open coverage/html/index.html
```

On macOS this opens the report in the default browser. The index page shows
per-directory and per-file hit rates. Click any file to see the annotated source.

## Filtering Out Generated Files

Flutter projects typically contain generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`,
`*.gen.dart`) that inflate coverage numbers. Strip them from the trace file
before running `genhtml`:

```bash
# Remove generated files from the lcov data
lcov \
  --remove coverage/lcov.info \
  '*.g.dart' \
  '*.freezed.dart' \
  '*.gen.dart' \
  '*/test/*' \
  --output-file coverage/lcov_filtered.info

# Then generate HTML from the filtered file
genhtml coverage/lcov_filtered.info \
  --output-directory coverage/html \
  --title "95octane Coverage" \
  --show-details \
  --highlight
```

## Full Workflow (copy-paste)

```bash
# 1. Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# 2. Filter out generated/test files
lcov \
  --remove coverage/lcov.info \
  '*.g.dart' '*.freezed.dart' '*.gen.dart' '*/test/*' \
  --output-file coverage/lcov_filtered.info

# 3. Generate HTML report
genhtml coverage/lcov_filtered.info \
  --output-directory coverage/html \
  --title "95octane Coverage" \
  --show-details \
  --highlight

# 4. Open in browser
open coverage/html/index.html
```

## Output Structure

```
coverage/
├── lcov.info              # Raw trace file from flutter test --coverage
├── lcov_filtered.info     # Filtered trace file (after lcov --remove)
└── html/
    ├── index.html         # Summary with per-directory hit rates
    ├── amber.png          # Status icons
    ├── [module]/
    │   ├── index.html     # Per-directory summary
    │   └── [file].dart.gcov.html  # Annotated source view
    └── ...
```

## Reading the Report

- **Green** lines — executed (hit) during tests
- **Red** lines — not executed (missed) during tests
- **Blue** (with `--highlight`) — recently changed lines
- The index shows `Lines: X%  (hit/found)` per file

## .gitignore Reminder

The `coverage/` directory (including the generated HTML) is typically git-ignored.
Confirm this is in `.gitignore`:

```
coverage/
```

## Troubleshooting

**`genhtml: command not found`**
```bash
brew install lcov
```

**`lcov.info` is empty or missing**
```bash
# Make sure you ran flutter test --coverage, not just flutter test
flutter test --coverage
```

**Source files not found warnings**
Run `genhtml` from the project root directory, or pass `--source-directory`:
```bash
cd /path/to/flutterApp
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
```

**`lcov --remove` flags a version mismatch**
Both `lcov` and `genhtml` come from the same brew package — make sure only one
version is installed:
```bash
brew list lcov
lcov --version
genhtml --version
```
