# Git Commit

This skill governs commits made in the **repository**

## Commit Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

or without a scope:

```text
<type>: <description>
```

- **Lowercase**, imperative mood, under 72 characters, no trailing period
- **Scope is optional** — use it when the change is clearly isolated to one
  section within the repo; omit it when the change spans multiple sections or is
  general
- Body and footer are optional; add them for non-obvious context

## Allowed Types

**Important Note:**

- Refer to `git-conventional-commits.yaml` for the authoritative list of allowed
  types & scopes
- Scope is optional but if used, must be one of the configured scopes

### Sample list of types (see config file for actual allowed types)

| Type       | When to use                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature or capability                               |
| `fix`      | Bug fix                                                 |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behaviour change             |
| `wip`      | Work in progress — not reviewed, not finished           |
| `spec`     | Specification or design document changes                |
| `test`     | Adding or correcting tests                              |
| `ops`      | Operational changes: CI, scripts, build config, tooling |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                                      |
| `merge`    | Merge commits (usually auto-generated)                  |

## Scopes

**Do not invent scopes.**, MUST look in `git-conventional-commits.yaml` for the
authoritative list of allowed scopes.

**Omit the scope** when a change touches multiple areas of the codebase or is
general in nature. For example, a commit that updates the pre-commit hook
versions would have type `ops` but no scope, since it affects multiple areas.

## Examples

```text
feat(service): add ride group endpoint
fix(worker): handle timeout in ride status workflow
refactor(common): simplify error factory helpers
test(service): add integration tests for user module
ops: update biome config for stricter rules
docs(service): document ride route handler
feat: add shared ride schema and update service handlers
wip(worker): prototype notification activity
```

## Workflow

1. Ensure you are working at the **repository root** (not inside a
   folder/submodule)
2. Run `git status` to see what changed
3. Stage only the relevant files (`git add <files>` — avoid `git add -A`)
4. Run `git diff --cached` to review what will be committed
5. Determine the type and scope from `git-conventional-commits.yaml` based on
   the changes being made
6. Write: `<type>(<scope>): <imperative description>` (with scope) or
   `<type>: <imperative description>` (without scope) as the commit message
7. Run `pre-commit run` to apply auto-fixes (prettier, markdownlint) and
   re-stage those changes before the final commit
8. Run: `git commit -m "<message>"`

Running `pre-commit run` before `git commit` ensures that auto-fixable
formatting issues are incorporated into the commit rather than appearing as a
dirty working tree afterwards.

## Pre-commit Hooks

The repository runs these hooks automatically:

- **conventional-commits validation** — rejects messages not matching allowed
  types; rejects unknown scope
- Other hooks depending on the repository configuration, refer to
  `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for details

> Note: The repository may or may not have a `no-commit-to-branch` hook.

If a hook fails, fix the issue and create a **new** commit (never `--amend`
after hook failure — the commit did not happen).

## Branch Rule

Avoid committing directly to `main` or `develop` for substantive changes. Use
feature branches and PRs, even though the repository root has no explicit hook
enforcement.

## Best Practices

- One logical change per commit
- Present tense: "add" not "added"
- Imperative mood: "fix bug" not "fixes bug"
- Reference issues (optional): `Closes #123`, `Refs #456`
- Keep description under 72 characters

## Git Safety Protocol

- NEVER update git config
- NEVER run destructive commands (`--force`, `hard reset`) without explicit user
  request
- NEVER skip hooks (`--no-verify`) unless the user explicitly asks
- NEVER force push to `main` or `develop` branches
- NEVER create pull requests — use the merge script instead
- If a commit fails due to hooks, fix the issue and create a **new** commit (do
  not amend — the previous commit did not happen)

## After commit

ALWAYS ask the user if they want to push after a successful commit. If they say
yes, run `git push` and confirm the push was successful. If they say no, end the
interaction.
