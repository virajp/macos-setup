# Fish Configuration: Homebrew
# =============================================================================
# This file is auto-sourced by Fish shell during startup.
# Files in conf.d/ are automatically loaded in alphabetical order.
#
# Environment variables referenced:
# - HOMEBREW_PREFIX: Homebrew installation prefix (defined in 01-env.fish)
#
# Only the shellenv bootstrap lives here. The HOMEBREW_* behaviour flags moved
# to mise's [env] block - `brew` reads them at runtime, not during startup.
#
# This must run BEFORE mise activates (51-): mise wins PATH precedence by
# prepending, so anything touching PATH after it takes precedence back.
