# Fish Configuration: PATH Management
# =============================================================================
# This file is auto-sourced by Fish shell during startup.
# Files in conf.d/ are automatically loaded in alphabetical order.
#
# Environment variables referenced:
# - HOMEBREW_PREFIX: Homebrew installation prefix (defined in 01-env.fish)
# - HOME: User home directory (system variable)
#
# PATH deliberately stays in shell config rather than moving to mise's
# [env] _.path. mise prepends _.path entries AHEAD of its own tool paths, so
# declaring ~/.local/bin there would shadow mise-managed tools with the
# standalone copies that live in it (uv and uvx, today). Keeping these here
# means mise activates afterwards and its tools correctly win.
#
# --global, not the default universal scope: universal entries persist in
# ~/.config/fish/fish_variables independently of this file, so a path removed
# here would survive forever. Global scope is rebuilt every startup.
#
# fish_add_path skips directories that do not exist, so stale entries simply
# stop being added rather than accumulating.
